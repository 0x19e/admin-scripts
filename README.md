# admin-scripts

## Description
A collection of useful Bash scripts covering a range of common administrative
tasks. Some of these scripts are collected from other sources, in which case
the header of the file will contain the author and other relavent information.

Note that these scripts were never really intended to be public, so do not
expect any warranties of any kind. Some of these scripts can be extremely
dangerous if used incorrectly and careless use could ruin your day.
